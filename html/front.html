		<h2>Usage Information</h2>

		<p>
			The web interface accepts a name, an IP, or an IP range and performs either a <strong>direct lookup</strong> or a <strong>2-step lookup</strong>. By default, the search performs a direct lookup if you give an IP or an IP range, and a 2-step lookup if you give a name.
		</p>

		<h3>Direct Lookup</h3>

		<p>
			A direct lookup is a simple lookup with only one step. If you give a name, it returns all IPs that have used this name; if you give an IP or IP range, it returns all names that have been used by the given IP (range). Results are displayed as distinct name-IP combinations with the timestamp and server information of their last sighting attached.
		</p>

		<h3>2-Step Lookup</h3>

		<p>
			A 2-step lookup only works on names: It first performs a direct lookup of the name to get all IPs that used the name, and then looks up all sightings by all those IPs. Like direct lookups, it returns distinct name-IP combinations with timestamp and server information of their last sighting.
		</p>

		<h3>IPs and IP Ranges</h3>

		<p>
			IPs (also in ranges) can be given partially, e.g. 177.159/8 will be parsed as 177.159.0.0/8 which in turn will return results in the subnet 177.0.0.0 -177.255.255.255.
		</p>

		<p>
			Note that since extinfo only sends the 3 highest IP bytes (24 bits), prefix sizes greater than 24 or greater than the default mask of the IP you specified will be ignored:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>/names/79.69/24 → 16 bits of IP specified, 24 prefix size will be ignored and replaced with the intuitive one, 16</li>
			<li>/names/17.203.21.45/26 → 26 is greater than 24, so the prefix size will be set to 24</li>
		</ul>
