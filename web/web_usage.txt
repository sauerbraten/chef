USAGE

/names     – sorts by name frequency, which means the most oftenly used name will be first
/lastseen  – sorts by timeliness, which means the most recent sighting will be first
/status    – displays database status (i.e. counts of recorded data)

/names and /lastseen commands take a name, an IP, or an IP range as argument and return the same results, only the sorting will be different.
IPs (also in ranges) can be given partially, e.g. 177.159/8 will be parsed as 177.159.0.0/8 which in turn will return results in the subnet 177.0.0.0.

examples:
  /names/unnamed
  /names/93.194
  /names/177.159/8
  /lastseen/novi
  /lastseen/141.3.23

use '_' instead of '/' in names, e.g. '/names/_dev_zero' to look up the name '/dev/zero' and '%3F' instead of '?'

note: since extinfo only sends the 3 highest IP bytes (24 bits), prefix sizes greater than 24 or greater than the default mask of the IP you specified will be ignored:

  /names/79.69/24 → 16 bits of IP specified, 24 prefix size will be ignored and replaced with the intuitive one, 16
  /names/17.203.21.45/26 → 26 is greater than 24, so the prefix size will be set to 24
