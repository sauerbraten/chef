# pubsub

A Go package implementing a topic-based publish-subscribe system using channels.

## Usage

Get the package:

	$ go get github.com/sauerbraten/pubsub

Import the package:

```go
import (
	"github.com/sauerbraten/pubsub"
)
```

Subscribers receive updates on channels provided to them when they subscribe to a topic. Topics are automatically created when you subscribe to them and they do not exist yet. In that case, a Publisher type is returned as well, providing methods to publish updates on the new topic. Topics are removed when a subscriber unsubscribes from it and there are no other subscribers left. Publishers include a stop channel from which reading only succeeds after the topic was removed.

## Example

```go
package main

import (
	"time"

	"github.com/sauerbraten/pubsub"
)

func main() {
	broker := pubsub.NewBroker()

	// subscribe to topic
	updates, newPublisher := broker.Subscribe("topic")
	if newPublisher != nil {
		// maybe start producing updates to receive
		go publish(newPublisher)
	}

	// subscribe many goroutines to the same topic
	// and/or
	// subscribe one goroutine to many different topics (requires additional publishing goroutines)

	// receive updates until broker unsubscribes you
	for update := range updates {
		// process update
	}

	// or, at some point, just unsubscribe
	broker.Unsubscribe(updates, "topic")
}

func publish(pub *pubsub.Publisher) {
	for {
		select {
		case <-pub.Stop:
			pub.Close()
			return

		case <-time.After(1 * time.Second):
			pub.Publish([]byte("update"))
		}
	}
}
```
