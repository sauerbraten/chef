// Package pubsub implements a topic-based publish-subscribe system using channels.
//
// Subscribers receive updates on channels provided to them when they subscribe to a topic. Topics
// are automatically created when you subscribe to them and they do not exist yet. In that case, a
// Publisher type is returned as well, providing methods to publish updates on the new topic. Topics
// are removed when a subscriber unsubscribes from it and there are no other subscribers left.
// Publishers include a stop channel from which reading only succeeds after the topic was removed.
